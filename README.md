# CirclingDetection

Steps for running detection on existing tracking data CSV:
1. Copy the repository locally
2. Create an Anaconda environment (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) from the included `.yaml`
3. Run `Circling_BoxAngle.py` either:
   - From the Anaconda prompt, type `python Circling_BoxAngle.py` after navigating to within the PathAnalysis folder
   - Using one of the development environments that can be downloaded from the Anaconda Navigator (e.g. Spyder)
   - *If the CSV was generated by a tracking method other than DeepLabCut, note that it (or a copy of it) should be modified to place the snout keypoint (x,y) coordinates in columns 2 & 3 and the tail keypoint (x,y) coordinates in columns 5 & 6*.
